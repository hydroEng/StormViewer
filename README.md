StormViewer is a tool for processing Plot Output (PO) csv files generated by TUFLOW models run for ARR2016 storm ensembles. This tool will determine the critical duration and temporal pattern for each storm event, and will also allow you to generate box plots summarizing storm maximum flow data. You also have the choice to write results to file.
