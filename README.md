# TUFLOW Ensemble Tool

![Tests](https://github.com/hydroEng/tuflow_ensemble/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

The TUFLOW Ensemble Tool bulk processes Plot Output (PO) csv files generated by TUFLOW models run for ARR2016 storm ensembles. This tool will determine the critical duration and temporal pattern for each storm, and will also generate box plots for each PO line and storm event.
